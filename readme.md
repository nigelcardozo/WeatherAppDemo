README

The purpose of this code is to show you how to create a simple weather app for Android.

This app utilises the libraries Volley to create HTTP Requests and Gson to parse the JSON responses.

The app currently supports two types of queries, location (latitude and longitude) or city. 

In order to get the latitude and longitude we use the network and the location sensors.

The app doesn't fully handle all error cases, it's simply a proof of concept to show how to implement such functionality utilising the appropriate libraries!


Please note that after syncing you may need to download Volley:

git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley


You will also need Gson:

Finally, I hope this code is of use, please feel free to download some of my free apps from the Google Play Store
